## Execution Notes
- Each persona works independently referencing project-context/1.define/prd.md and sad.md.
- Build-phase artifacts live under project-context/2.build/; Deliver artifact is project-context/3.deliver/deploy.md.
- Mark “future work” visibly in UI and docs as needed.
- Update this index as epics progress or new ones are added.
